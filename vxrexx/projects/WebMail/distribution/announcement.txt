I've released a new version of WebMail/2.

WebMail/2 is a web to email gateway. WebMail/2 allows you to use your
web browser as a full-featured e-mail client. It does this by interfacing
your web server with your e-mail server and allowing the web browser to
send and receive e-mail information. You can use your existing email
solution with WebMail/2, you are not required to change anything from
your current configuration.

Features among other:

Authentication daemon, multiple user databases, dynamicly parsed HTML files,
full REXX CGI procedures, Contacts manager, Signature support, admins can
change the code to their own needs and add more functionality. Unlimited
number of emails can be listed, sorted in multiple pages, Upload and Download
of file attachments, themes, external authentication, high security per user
and via APOP, web server authentication. New User Registration feature allows
users to create their own email accounts. Extra features like multiple languages
and X-Face support.
